# Python
code snippets and stuff for Python
## Programm Setup
Install virtualenv, using pyenv is not necessary but I like it to keep my python versions managed.
```
pyenv local 3.9.0
python -m venv
```

## Beautiful Soup
Use beautiful soup for scraping and manipulating html content
```
pip install bs4
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
```
