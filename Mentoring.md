# Mentoring Notes
In mentoring I cam to the conclusion there are two approaches many people take. 
Cabs and Trains

## Cabs.
Cabs pick passengers up where they are and drive them to the destination where 
they need to be. 
This is the equivalent of one on one mentoring or tutoring. The mentor acts patiently
adjusting the working material to the level of the mentee. The speed is adjusted 
the the mentee as well ensuring they understand the content and follow the concepts.
This approach does not work with more than a few people, let's say 10, especially
not if they are on widely different levels.
This also highlights another issue of this approach; it is not scalable.

## Trains
Trains on the other hand pick up people at the trainstation and drive them all
at the same speed to the next stop.
This is the equivalent of big classrooms, online or video tutorials. There is
limited option to interact with students and connect with theis specific needs.
This comes especially true when content is delivered on-demand and online where
teacher and students can reside in different timezones and watch the lessons on 
different times.
