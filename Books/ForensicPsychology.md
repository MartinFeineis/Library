# Forensic Psychology for Dummies
*Professor David Canter*

## Part I: Nailing Forensic Psychology: A moving target
__p024__: __Reliability:__ How consistently a procedure measures what it measures. (e.g. elastic measuring tape 
gives different results for every measure.)
__Validity:__ How well it measures what it claims to measure. (a proxy metric)

__p031__: Studying criminals means people who are convicted of crime. Not everyone
who does something morally wrong, is legally a criminal.

__p034__: Criminal characteristics:
* Mostly men (80%)
* usually mid- to late teens
* coming from dysfunctional families
* access to other criminals (friends, family) [crimes as behaviour is normalized]
* they probably have low education

__p035__:
* nature vs. nurture; some general personality traits - desire for excitement,
impulsivity and low intelligence
* Many thieves see burglary as an exciting opportunity and not a carefully
considered way of making money.

__p037__: Female offenders:
* Commit less crimes (only 20% see above)
* Court decisions tend to be more lenient towards women for reasons like:
    * motherhood
    * perception of less wickedness

__p039__: Thinking about crime:
* Denial: It didn't happen or not as being claimed.
* Justification: Moral authority, need or entitlement to the crime.
* Minimisation: It wasn't that bad.
* Rationalisation: Shifting the blame to the victim (Opportunity makes thieves, 
Victim shaming/blaming),
"If they didn't want to get robbed they shouldn't have carried a wallet."

__p041__: Personality traits more common in criminals than non-criminals
* External locus of control: The idea if wether one controls their own destiny
 (internal locus) or fate (external locus) does. Criminals tend to the latter, 
however research isn't cut-clear.
* Lack of empathy: Some criminals don't have the ability to feel what others/their 
victims are feeling.
* Lack of self-control: Impulsivity or a reluctance to delay gratification.
Some highly successful people are on the opposite spectrucm.
* Search for excitement: Many criminals are sensation seekers, that enjoy the
excitement of committing a crime.
__p043__: Mental Disorders:
* Sadism: origin [Marquis de Sade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marquis_de_Sade)
Causing suffering and humiliating the victim gives pleasuer to the sadist, they 
are likely to be fascinated by weapons and violence.
* Narcissism: A narcissist is wholly preoccupied with success, hypersensitive to
criticism, self-important and feels entitled to admiration. They can get furious 
when being ignored and their desires not met, in these cases they might attack.
* Borderline Personality Disorder: People with mood swings, difficulties forming 
stable relastionships and getting intensly angry without reason.

__p135__: 4 prevalent criminal narratives:
* __Being on Adventure__: Crime is seen as exciting escape (escapism from boring 
reality, and search for excitement). Spoils go to the victor, here the offender.
* __Being on a heroic mission__: Avening insult or defending/restoring honour of self
or others (see honour killings). Offender sees himself as justified hero.
* __Being a tragic victim__: Offender feels to always draw the short stick and being 
a misunderstood.
* __Being a professional__: Usually older ones see crime as just what they do and might 
develop some professionl pride (like robbing a bank with noone getting hurt)

__p141__: Working on violent crimes:
* Expressive violence: an outburst of emotional feelings
* Instrumental violence: Violence is being used as a means to an end.
__p332__: B.F. Skinner - Stages in the  _wise parenting_ process:
1. Building rapport and trust with the family by relating to theis daily concerns and experiences.
2. Establishing goals of what the family wants to achieve (see "Lack of commitment issue in 5 dysfunctions of a Team)
3. Reviewing any success in achieving initial changes, however small, so that the family begins to feel that the process is having some effect.
4. Identify parenting skills that can be developed and tried out between sessions with the therapist.

__p175__: Tony Blair (british PM) 'tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime'
Succeeding only in displacing crime:
* Moving area: crime spots are getting surveiled by CCTV cameras so different crime spots emerge.
* changing timing: burglaries happen when security guards shift or are away.
* changing operational procedures: wearing hoodies to prevent identification, car 
thefts at gunpoint due to new key technologies.
* changing nature or targets: terrorists attack civilians as politicians increase
securitye
__p179__: Reducing crime rate by changing the law.
* abolishing prohibition
* legalising homosexuality 
* legalising drugs
The crime rate looks better now but alcoholism and drug abuse are still a problem. 

__p182__: Strategies to negotiate with kidnappers:
* Confirmation: Assuring the kidnapper has authority over the hostage and giving them room
to manoeuvre "I know you can do it, I don't want you to make it worse."
* Authorisation: Building rapport with the kidnapper against a higher power "I want to
give you a car to get out, but the higher ups don't let me."
* Complicating: Introducing circumstances the kidnapper might not have thought of hence limiting
their assumptions on whats possible. 
* Testing: Directly challenging the hostage-taker about what they are threatening. Stating
they are not going to hame the hostage if there is a peaceful solution.

__p191__: Personality test:
Projective Procedures:
* Rohrschach inkblot: looking at ambigous images indicate aspects of subconsious mind.
* Thematic Apperception Test (TAT): Stories about ambigous images are interpreted.
* Szondi Test: Novel tes asking which face drawing is preferred, to indicate mental state.
Objective Questionaire style tests:
* Minnesota Multiphase Personality Inventory (MMPI): 600 Binary questions
* Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory (MCMI): Assessment of mental illness.
* Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI): 344 Questions to assess problems for treament planning
Measure of intellect/cognition:
* Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS): Standard intelligence test
* Trail Making Tests A and B: testing how quickly a person can do visual tasks
* Luria-Nebraska Neurophysiological Battery: 269 items to measure brain functions.A

__p198__: Thinking abilities:
* Attention: Ability to focus on a specific task and readiness to be distracted.
* Memory: Ability to remember short and long term.
* Reasoning: Ability to draw logical conclusions from presented information.

__p199__: Personality Dimensions
* Agreeablness
