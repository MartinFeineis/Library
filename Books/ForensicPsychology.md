# Forensic Psychology for Dummies
*Professor David Canter*

## Part I: Nailing Forensic Psychology: A moving target
__p024__: __Reliability:__ How consistently a procedure measures what it measures. (e.g. elastic measuring tape 
gives different results for every measure.)
__Validity:__ How well it measures what it claims to measure. (a proxy metric)

__p031__: Studying criminals means people who are convicted of crime. Not everyone
who does something morally wrong, is legally a criminal.

__p034__: Criminal characteristics:
* Mostly men (80%)
* usually mid- to late teens
* coming from dysfunctional families
* access to other criminals (friends, family) [crimes as behaviour is normalized]
* they probably have low education
