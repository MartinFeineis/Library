# Forensic Psychology for Dummies
*Professor David Canter*

## Part I: Nailing Forensic Psychology: A moving target
__p024__: __Reliability:__ How consistently a procedure measures what it measures. (e.g. elastic measuring tape 
gives different results for every measure.)
__Validity:__ How well it measures what it claims to measure. (a proxy metric)

__p031__: Studying criminals means people who are convicted of crime. Not everyone
who does something morally wrong, is legally a criminal.

__p034__: Criminal characteristics:
* Mostly men (80%)
* usually mid- to late teens
* coming from dysfunctional families
* access to other criminals (friends, family) [crimes as behaviour is normalized]
* they probably have low education

__p035__:
* nature vs. nurture; some general personality traits - desire for excitement,
impulsivity and low intelligence
* Many thieves see burglary as an exciting opportunity and not a carefully
considered way of making money.

__p037__: Female offenders:
* Commit less crimes (only 20% see above)
* Court decisions tend to be more lenient towards women for reasons like:
    * motherhood
    * perception of less wickedness

__p039__: Thinking about crime:
* Denial: It didn't happen or not as being claimed.
* Justification: Moral authority, need or entitlement to the crime.
* Minimisation: It wasn't that bad.
* Rationalisation: Shifting the blame to the victim (Opportunity makes thieves),
"If they didn't want to get robbed they shouldn't have carried a wallet."
