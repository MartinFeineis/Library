# Forensic Psychology for Dummies
*Professor David Canter*

## Part I: Nailing Forensic Psychology: A moving target
__p024__: __Reliability:__ How consistently a procedure measures what it measures. (e.g. elastic measuring tape 
gives different results for every measure.)
__Validity:__ How well it measures what it claims to measure. (a proxy metric)

__p031__: Studying criminals means people who are convicted of crime. Not everyone
who does something morally wrong, is legally a criminal.

__p034__: Criminal characteristics:
* Mostly men (80%)
* usually mid- to late teens
* coming from dysfunctional families
* access to other criminals (friends, family) [crimes as behaviour is normalized]
* they probably have low education

__p035__:
* nature vs. nurture; some general personality traits - desire for excitement,
impulsivity and low intelligence
* Many thieves see burglary as an exciting opportunity and not a carefully
considered way of making money.

__p037__: Female offenders:
* Commit less crimes (only 20% see above)
* Court decisions tend to be more lenient towards women for reasons like:
    * motherhood
    * perception of less wickedness

__p039__: Thinking about crime:
* Denial: It didn't happen or not as being claimed.
* Justification: Moral authority, need or entitlement to the crime.
* Minimisation: It wasn't that bad.
* Rationalisation: Shifting the blame to the victim (Opportunity makes thieves, 
Victim shaming/blaming),
"If they didn't want to get robbed they shouldn't have carried a wallet."

__p041__: Personality traits more common in criminals than non-criminals
* External locus of control: The idea if wether one controls their own destiny
 (internal locus) or fate (external locus) does. Criminals tend to the latter, 
however research isn't cut-clear.
* Lack of empathy: Some criminals don't have the ability to feel what others/their 
victims are feeling.
* Lack of self-control: Impulsivity or a reluctance to delay gratification.
Some highly successful people are on the opposite spectrucm.
* Search for excitement: Many criminals are sensation seekers, that enjoy the
excitement of committing a crime.

__p043__: Mental Disorders:
* Sadism: origin [Marquis de Sade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marquis_de_Sade)
Causing suffering and humiliating the victim gives pleasuer to the sadist, they 
are likely to be fascinated by weapons and violence.
* Narcissism: A narcissist is wholly preoccupied with success, hypersensitive to
criticism, self-important and feels entitled to admiration. They can get furious 
when being ignored and their desires not met, in these cases they might attack.
* Borderline Personality Disorder: People with mood swings, difficulties forming 
stable relastionships and getting intensly angry without reason.

__p135__: 4 prevalent criminal narratives:
* __Being on Adventure__: Crime is seen as exciting escape (escapism from boring 
reality, and search for excitement). Spoils go to the victor, here the offender.
* __Being on a heroic mission__: Avening insult or defending/restoring honour of self
or others (see honour killings). Offender sees himself as justified hero.
* __Being a tragic victim__: Offender feels to always draw the short stick and being 
a misunderstood.
* __Being a professional__: Usually older ones see crime as just what they do and might 
develop some professionl pride (like robbing a bank with noone getting hurt)

__p141__: Working on violent crimes:
* Expressive violence: an outburst of emotional feelings
* Instrumental violence: Violence is being used as a means to an end.

__p175__: Tony Blair (british PM) 'tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime'
Succeeding only in displacing crime:
* Moving area: crime spots are getting surveiled by CCTV cameras so different crime spots emerge.
* changing timing: burglaries happen when security guards shift or are away.
* changing operational procedures: wearing hoodies to prevent identification, car 
thefts at gunpoint due to new key technologies.
* changing nature or targets: terrorists attack civilians as politicians increase
security

__p179__: Reducing crime rate by changing the law.
* abolishing prohibition
* legalising homosexuality 
* legalising drugs
The crime rate looks better now but alcoholism and drug abuse are still a problem. 

__p182__: Strategies to negotiate with kidnappers:
* Confirmation: Assuring the kidnapper has authority over the hostage and giving them room
to manoeuvre "I know you can do it, I don't want you to make it worse."
* Authorisation: Building rapport with the kidnapper against a higher power "I want to
give you a car to get out, but the higher ups don't let me."
* Complicating: Introducing circumstances the kidnapper might not have thought of hence limiting
their assumptions on whats possible. 
* Testing: Directly challenging the hostage-taker about what they are threatening. Stating
they are not going to hame the hostage if there is a peaceful solution.

__p191__: Personality test:
Projective Procedures:
* Rohrschach inkblot: looking at ambigous images indicate aspects of subconsious mind.
* Thematic Apperception Test (TAT): Stories about ambigous images are interpreted.
* Szondi Test: Novel tes asking which face drawing is preferred, to indicate mental state.

* Minnesota Multiphase Personality Inventory (MMPI): 600 Binary questions
* Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory (MCMI): Assessment of mental illness.
* Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI): 344 Questions to assess problems for treament planning
Measure of intellect/cognition:
* Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS): Standard intelligence test
* Trail Making Tests A and B: testing how quickly a person can do visual tasks
* Luria-Nebraska Neurophysiological Battery: 269 items to measure brain functions.A

__p198__: Thinking abilities:
* Attention: Ability to focus on a specific task and readiness to be distracted.
* Memory: Ability to remember short and long term.
* Reasoning: Ability to draw logical conclusions from presented information.
