# Forensic Psychology for Dummies
*Professor David Canter*

## Part I: Nailing Forensic Psychology: A moving target
__p024__: __Reliability:__ How consistently a procedure measures what it measures. (e.g. elastic measuring tape 
gives different results for every measure.)
__Validity:__ How well it measures what it claims to measure. (a proxy metric)

__p031__: Studying criminals means people who are convicted of crime. Not everyone
who does something morally wrong, is legally a criminal.

__p034__: Criminal characteristics:
* Mostly men (80%)
* usually mid- to late teens
* coming from dysfunctional families
* access to other criminals (friends, family) [crimes as behaviour is normalized]
* they probably have low education

__p035__:
* nature vs. nurture; some general personality traits - desire for excitement,
impulsivity and low intelligence
* Many thieves see burglary as an exciting opportunity and not a carefully
considered way of making money.

__p037__: Female offenders:
* Commit less crimes (only 20% see above)
* Court decisions tend to be more lenient towards women for reasons like:
    * motherhood
    * perception of less wickedness

__p039__: Thinking about crime:
* Denial: It didn't happen or not as being claimed.
* Justification: Moral authority, need or entitlement to the crime.
* Minimisation: It wasn't that bad.
* Rationalisation: Shifting the blame to the victim (Opportunity makes thieves, 
Victim shaming/blaming),
"If they didn't want to get robbed they shouldn't have carried a wallet."

__p041__: Personality traits more common in criminals than non-criminals
* External locus of control: The idea if wether one controls their own destiny
 (internal locus) or fate (external locus) does. Criminals tend to the latter, 
however research isn't cut-clear.
* Lack of empathy: Some criminals don't have the ability to feel what others/their 
victims are feeling.
* Lack of self-control: Impulsivity or a reluctance to delay gratification.
Some highly successful people are on the opposite spectrucm.
* Search for excitement: Many criminals are sensation seekers, that enjoy the
excitement of committing a crime.
__p043__: Mental Disorders:
* Sadism: origin [Marquis de Sade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marquis_de_Sade)
Causing suffering and humiliating the victim gives pleasuer to the sadist, they 
are likely to be fascinated by weapons and violence.
* Narcissism: A narcissist is wholly preoccupied with success, hypersensitive to
criticism, self-important and feels entitled to admiration. They can get furious 
when being ignored and their desires not met, in these cases they might attack.
