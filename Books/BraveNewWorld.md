* __p030__: "The lower the caste," said Mr. Foster, "the shorter the oxygen." The first organ affected was the brain. After that the skeleton. At seventy per cent of normal oxygen you got dwarfs. At less than seventy eyeless monsters. "Who are no use at all," concluded Mr. Foster.
* __p040__: What man has joined, nature is powerless to put [asunder](https://www.dict.cc/?s=asunder).
* __p049__: Roses and electric shocks, the khaki of Deltas and a whiff os asfœtida -- wedded indissolubly before the child can speak. But wordless conditioning is crude and wholesale; cannot bring home the finer distinctions, cannot inculate the more complex courses of behaviour. For that there must be words, but words without reason. In brief, sleep teaching or, hypnopædia.
* __p053__: "strange to think that even in Our Ford's day most games were played without more apparatus than a ball or two and a few sticks and perhaps a bit of netting."
* __P053__: In a little grassy bay between tall clumps of Mediterranean heather, two children, a little boy of about seven and a little girl who might have been a year older, were playing, very gravely and with all the focussed attention of scientists intent on a labour of discovery, a rudimentary ☆☆☆☆☆ game. "Charming, charming!" the D.H.C. repeated sentimentally.
* __p054__: "It's just that this little boy seems rather reluctant to join in the ordinary ☆☆☆☆☆ play."
* __p057__: His fordship Mustapha Mond
* __p060__: Mustapha Mond leaned forward, shook a finger at them. "Just try to realize it," he said, and his voice sent a strange thrill quivering along their diaphragms. "Try to realize what it was like to have a [viviparous](https://www.dict.cc/?s=viviparous) mother." That smutty word again. But none of them dreamed, this time, of smiling. "Try to imagine what 'living with one's family' meant." They tried; but obviously without the smallest success. "And do know what a 'home' was?" They shook their heads.
* __p068__: "Their world didn't allow them to take things easily, didn't allow them to be sane, virtuous, happy." - The Controller
* __p069__: "Stability", said the Controller, "stability. No civilization without social stability. No social stability without individual stability." His voice was a trumpet.
* __p074__: "I once had to wait nearly four weeks before a girl I wanted would let me have her."
* __p076__: "Or the Caste System." ... "As though men were more than physico-chemically equal."
* __p077__: "Phosgene, chloropicrin, ethyl iodoacetate, diphenylcyanarsine, trichlormethyl, chloroformate, dichlorethyl sulphide. Not to mention hydrocyanic acid."
* __p077__: $Ch_3C_6H_2(NO_2)3 + HG(CNO)_2$ = well, what? - Trinitrotoluene (T.N.T.) and Mercury Fulminate two explosives
* __p080__: "Then came the famous British Museum Massacre. Two thousand culture fans gassed with [dichlorethylsulphide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustard_gas)"
* __p086__: "One cubic centimetrecures ten gloomy sentiments", siad the Assistan Predestinator citing a piece of homely hypnopædic wisdom. - on Soma

* __p097__: [Riemann-surface tennis](https://prezi.com/dkdxkn4jmusq/riemann-surface-tennis/)
* __p101__: A chronic fear of being slighted made him avoid his equals - Bernard
* __p103__: In a forcible emphatic way, he was handsome and looked, as his secretary was never tired of repeating, every centimetre an Alpha-Plus. - Helmholtz Watson
* __p106__: A physical shortcoming could produce a kind of mental excess. The process, it seemed, was reversible. Mental excess could produce, for its own purposes, the voluntary blindness and deafness of deliberate solitude, the artificial impotence of asceticism.
* __p115__: It was a night almost without clouds, moonless and starry; but of this on the whole depressing fact Lenina and Henry were fortunately unaware.
* __p117__: Malthusian Blues: refers to the feelings of despair or pessimism stemming from [Thomas Malthus's theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malthusianism)
* __p121__: near-wind and superstring: type of intrument
* __p128__: Big Henry had just sung eleven.
* __p130__: old-fashioned -- no television laid on in the bedrooms, no scent organ, only the most putrid synthetic music
* __p134__: tremoloing falsettos: type of singing
* __p135__: "Yes, I know," said Bernard derisively. "'Even Epsilons are useful'! So am I. And damned well wish I weren't!" Lenina was shocked by his blasphemy.
* __p136__: He laughed, "Yes, 'Everybody's happy nowadays.' We begin giving the children that at five. But wouldn't you like to be free to be happy in some other way, Lenina? In your own way, for example; not in everybody else's way."
* __p138__: "A little jolt, and they were off."
* __p139__: "Never put off till to-morrow the fun you can have today." - Lenina
* __p145__: For Bernard left the room with a swagger, exulting, as he banged the door behind him, in the thought that he stood alone, embattled against the order of things; elated by the intoxicating consciousness of his individual significance and imprtance.
* __p147__: hot contraceptives: warme Empfängnisverhütungsmittel
* __p149__: brachycephalic Alpha-Minus: kurzköpfiger Aplha Minus
* __p152__: Athapascan ; [Nothern american languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athabaskan_languages)

* __p155__: "drawn down by whiff of carrion"
* __p155__: "Taos and Tesuque; over Nambe and Picuris and Pojoaque, over Sia and Cochiti, over Laguna and Acoma and the Enchanted Mesa, over Zuñi and Cibola and Ojo Caliente"

* __p171__: The multitudinous seas incarnadine - [from Shakespearse Macbeth](https://www.folger.edu/explore/shakespeares-works/macbeth/read/2/2/?q=The%20multitudinous%20seas%20incarnadine#line-2.2.74)

* __p193__: "The seed of men and all creatures, the seed of the sund and the seed of earth and the seed of the sky -- Awonawilona made them out of the Fog on Increase. Now the world has four wombs; and he laid seeds in the lowest of the lowest of the four wombs. And gradually the seeds began to grow ..."

* __p216__: "His intellectual eminence carries with it a corresponding moral responsibilities. The greater a man's talents, the greater his power to lead astray. It is better that one should suffer than that many should be corrupted. Consider the matter dispassionately, Mr. Foster, and you will see tha no offence is so heinous as unorthodoxy of behaviour. Murder kills only the individual -- and, after all, what is an individual?"
* __p221__: The word (for "father" was not so much obscene as -- with its connotation of something at one remove from the loathsomeness and moral obliquity of child-bearing -- merely gross, a scatological rather tha a pornographic impropriety)
* __p227__: "... where the music of the radio was a labyrinth of sonorous colours, a sliding, palpitating labyrinth, that led (by what beautifully inevitable windings) to a bright centre of absolute conviction; where the dancing images of the television box were the performers in some indescribably delicious all-singing feely; where the dripping patchouli was more than a scent -- was the sun, was a million sexophones, was Popé making love, only much more so, incomparably more, and without end."
