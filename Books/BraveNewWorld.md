* __p080__: "Then came the famous British Museum Massacre. Two thousand culture fans gassed with [dichlorethylsulphide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustard_gas)"

* __p106__: A physical shortcoming could produce a kind of mental excess. The process, it seemed, was reversible. Mental excess could produce, for its own purposes, the voluntary blindness and deafness of deliberate solitude, the artificial impotence of asceticism.

* __p138__: "A little jolt, and they were off."
* __139__: "Never put off till to-morrow the fun you can have today." - Lenina
* __145__: For Bernard left the room with a swagger, exulting, as he banged the door behind him, in the thought that he stood alone, embattled against the order of things; elated by the intoxicating consciousness of his individual significance and imprtance.
* __p147__: hot contraceptives: warme Empfängnisverhütungsmittel
* __p149__: brachycephalic Alpha-Minus: kurzköpfiger Aplha Minus
